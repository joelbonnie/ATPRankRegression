    "Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, we will be making use of Assocation of Tennis Profesionals (ATP) results data to predict what characteristics make the 'ultimate player'. The dataset we are using has been compiled from Jeff Slackmans Github page (https://github.com/JeffSackmann/tennis_atp). The dataset contains information regarding the players, the match, and the tournament the match was played in. We aim to determine which player characteristics best predict the outcome of a tennis match. More aptly, if a player with a given set of characterisitcs appeared, how likely is it that they would win a match against another player with a different set of characterisitcs? Examples of player characteristics include age, handedness, height and ATP rank\n",
    "\n",
    "Match characteristics, though included in the dataset, cannot be used in this project, as they would \"give away\" the outcome of the match to the classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are asking a regression question, as we are attempting to discern if one or more variables can be used to predict a numerical variable of interest, in this case, the optimal age, handedness, rank, height, etc. for a player, or in other words, how often does a player of x height/age/rank win?"
